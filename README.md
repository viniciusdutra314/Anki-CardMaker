# Installation
The most reliable way of installing a template on anki is importing a deck with cards created using the template, in order to do that the we gonna run a Google Colab script that will generate the deck  for us, please click this link and follow the inscrutions


(if you're a developer you can run the create_template.py by yourself)

### Support on Linux:
Unfortunately, Linux doesn't come with TTS by default like the other operational systems, one easy solution is to install the anki-addon [AwesomeTTS](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1436550454), it will generate audios using online services like Google Translate, you need to create a preset selecting a service/voice for your target language and this is it.

The audios will continue to be generated on the fly and other voices will be avaiable on your different devices
